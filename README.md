# Aid Platform
This is a hands-on project where I intend to learn more about Quarkus and its ecosystem by building different microservices and serverless APIs.

## Services
- [service_boilerplate](https://github.com/Tavet/AidPlatform/tree/main/services/service_boilerplate)
    This is a boilerplate for a microservice in Quarkus applying Ports & Adapters architecture (aka Hexagonal Architecture)
